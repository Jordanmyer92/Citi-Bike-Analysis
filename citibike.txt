My analysis shows that both the starting and ending stations with the highest average trip duration are all located near some sort of attraction or hub. The station at Hanover Pl & Livingston St is loacated in an area with several restaurants. The station at Willoughby Ave & Walworth St is near a school, which could explain why this location has the second highest average trip duration for starting stations.
Kids could be using the bikes from this station to ride home from school. The station at Cleveland Pl & Spring St is near a park. Most likely people are riding the bikes around the park. This could explain why it has the third highest average trip duration for starting stations. The station at FDR Drive & E 35th St is located in front of the ferry dock. This station has the highest average trip duration for an ending station and is most likely being used by people who are using the ferry.
They rent the bikes elsewhere and ride to the ferry dock. The stations at Central Park S & 6 Ave and Grand Army Plaza & Central Park S have the second and third highest average trip duration for ending stations. They are both located near central park and are most likely used by people who rode to and/or around central park. Citibikes should be located around these types of places to generate maximum revenue per bike.
